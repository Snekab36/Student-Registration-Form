# Student-Registration-Form
This project is a simple registration form that includes the following fields:

Name

Email

Password

The form performs real-time validation using JavaScript and only allows submission when all fields are valid.

✅ Requirements Implemented
1️⃣ Name Field

Must not be empty

Shows an error message if left blank

2️⃣ Email Field

Must be in valid email format

Shows an error message if invalid

3️⃣ Password Field

Must contain at least 6 characters

Shows an error message if too short

4️⃣ Submit Button

Disabled by default

Enabled only after all fields are valid

✅ Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the form

CSS – Basic styling

JavaScript – Real-time validation and control of the submit button

✅ How It Works

User types in each field.

JavaScript listens to the input event.

Each field is validated immediately:

Empty or invalid input → Error message displayed

Valid input → Error message removed

When all fields are valid → Submit button is enabled

On submit → Form submission is prevented and success message is shown
